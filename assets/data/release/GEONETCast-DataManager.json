This release solved the following problems:\r\n\r\n- Deletion of (old) files in the source folder is disabled If the user has chosen to copy the files.\r\n- For files that do not match any pattern and should be placed in the specified \"Unmatched files folder\", the message was \"moving unmatched files\", even if the user has selected to copy. Only the message was wrong, the copy or move was performed according to the preference.\r\n\r\n## Files\r\n\r\nPlease ignore the source code downloads here. "}
