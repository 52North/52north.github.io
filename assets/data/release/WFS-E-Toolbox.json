The major changes are:\r\n\r\n- Incorporated new routines to import and process the Met-UK Exeter office UDM for various layers. Provision of 3 generic import routines: UDM_gph.bat, UDM_various_2m.bat, UDM_atmosph.bat and use of own created georef (at 0.15 degree). The original coordinate info file is incorrect.\r\n  - 2mDewpoint: Dew point temperature [C], timesteps 17, from 0, with 3 hr interval (total 48 hr forecast - 172800 sec)\r\n  - 2mRH: Relative humidity [%], timesteps 17, from 0, with 3 hr interval (total 48 hr forecast - 172800 sec)\r\n  - 2mSpecificHumidity: Specific humidity [kg/kg], timesteps 17, from 0, with 3 hr interval (total 48 hr forecast - 172800 sec)\r\n  - 2mTemperature: Temperature [C], timesteps 17, from 0, with 3 hr interval (total 48 hr forecast - 172800 sec)\r\n  - ConvectiveCloud: Convective cloud cover [%] range 0 - 1 , timesteps 17, from 0, with 3 hr interval (total 48 hr forecast - 172800 sec)\r\n  - ConvectiveRainRate: Unit - , timesteps 17, from 0, with 3 hr interval (total 48 hr forecast - 172800 sec)\r\n  - DynamicRainRate: Unit - , timesteps 17, from 0, with 3 hr interval (total 48 hr forecast - 172800 sec)\r\n  - GPH: for 850, 750, 500, 250 per timestep o LWRadiation: Net long wave radiation flux (surface) [W/m^2]\r\n  - TotalPrecipAcc: Total precipitation [kg/m^2] / 0[-] SFC (Ground or water surface), timesteps 17, from 0, with 3 hr interval (total 48 hr forecast - 172800 sec) \r\n- Removed the btool (bufrtool, from Northern Lighthouse) routine and replaced it with bufrextract (http://www.elnath.org.uk/). This version is only available for 64 bits OS! The following routines are affected: ASCAT_ssm_import.bat, MPEF_eth_toz_import.bat, MPEF_eth_th_ import.bat, MPEF_eth_gii_ import.bat, MPEF_eth_csr_import.bat, MPEF_eth_cla_import.bat, MPEF_eth_amv_import.bat \r\n- Added processing routines for the GIACIS project. Separate user manual are provided for these routines, see also: http://g4aw.spaceoffice.nl/en/Projects/G4AW-projects/64/Geodatafor-Innovative-Agricultural-Credit-Insurance-Schemes-GIACIS.html \r\n - Added routines to import Proba V:  VPI (unit in percentage) and DMP (unit as kg dry matter per ha / day), Burnt Area (BA) for First date of burn in the dekad (FDOB_DEKAD), Small Water Bodies (WB) (Value 75 and 150), FAPAR and Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) (unit in percentage)\r\n\r\nMore details in the [changelog](http://52north.org/communities/earth-observation/wfs-e-toolbox/changelog) on our [homepage](http://52north.org/).\r\n\r\n# Files\r\n\r\nPlease ignore the source code downloads here."}
