release contains several bug fixes, improvements and a few new features. See the [Change log](https://github.com/52North/Ilwis3Downloads/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for more details. The ILWIS 3.8 Visualization reference document is available [here](http://52north.org/files/ilwis/ILWIS_3.8_Map_Visualization.pdf).\r\n\r\n## Changes in 3.8.6:\r\n- Restored the on-screen digitizer (create and edit point map, create and edit segment map)\r\n- Restored the MapView functionality (the composition of several layers can be stored as a MapView, in order to be re-opened at a later time)\r\n- Added support for grid-like georeferences with thousands of control points; for now, such a georeference can only be imported from external data\r\n- Revision of the annotations to make them work correctly: grid, graticule, class legend, value legend, map border, scale bar, north arrow, whitespace tool\r\n- Added Triple Collocation application\r\n- Revised the Georeference Tiepoints editor\r\n- Revised the Hovmoller, Track Profile and Cross Section tools\r\n- Revised the animations and the Animation Management tool\r\n- The mouse wheel now zooms in / out the MapWindow; if the previous behavior is required, this can be set in the ILWIS Preferences\r\n- Improved robustness and correctness of CSV file importing\r\n- A maplist can now be exported as multiband GeoTiff, ERDAS or ENVI format\r\n- Added a spatial index to speed up selection in feature maps (segments, polygons)\r\n- Added light options to 3D Extrusion\r\n- In 3D view, objects are no longer disappearing when zooming in too much\r\n- In 3D view, polygons no longer blend with each other when they are too near\r\n- Restored the 3D cursor in the 3D Stack tool\r\n- In 3D view, when zooming close, the rotation point changes to the viewpoint instead of the gravity center, which makes navigation easier\r\n- Pixel size of submap georefs of latlonwgs84 maps is now expressed in degrees (previously in meters)\r\n- Many consistency improvements in the Create GeoReference forms\r\n- Pixelinfo can now be re-opened after it is closed\r\n- Now it is possible to change the line style for polygon boundaries and for segment maps\r\n- Restored the 3D self-height option in Maplist animation\r\n- GDAL-Importing a single file with a single layer no longer results in an object collection\r\n- Added \"Lambert Conformal Conic 1972\", \"Lambert Conformal Conic 2008\" and \"Lambert Conformal Conic 1SP\"\r\n- Now opening a MapList that is inside an ObjectCollection works\r\n- Enabled coloring Bool layers (previously the defaults could never be changed)\r\n- Importing data where the source and destination folders differ from the current catalog now works\r\n- When the display attribute of a pointmap/segmentmap/polygonmap is set to a column that has undefineds, now the undefined objects are hidden\r\n- In 3D view, after setting a map to use 3D-heights, it is now possible to set it back to \"None\"\r\n- Table import is now protected against duplicate column names\r\n- Added North Arrow\r\n- Export via GDAL (e.g. GTiff) in a folder with spaces now works properly\r\n- The DEM hydro processing functions are now able to work with raster images larger than 6000x6000 pixels, without giving \"Out of Memory\" errors\r\n- Edit->Copy on a MapWindow with a Legend now also copies the legend-texts\r\n- Added support for Edit->Copy on a MapWindow containing a Space Time Cube and related elements (Space Time Path, Stations, 3D Windrose and Flocks)\r\n- Choosing \"black\" as the symbol color for single colored maps now makes the symbols black instead of transparent\r\n- The order of the SEBS applications menu is now the working order, instead of alphabetic\r\n- The Table to Pointmap operation now gives correct values to the output map\r\n- Solved occasionally showing '*' instead of the projected coordinates in the statusbar of the MapWindow\r\n- In WMS/OSM services, added support for tiles with color palette, support for https, and support for additional request parameters\r\n- The WMS/OSM tiles now connect seamlessly, if the available OpenGL version is at least 1.2\r\n- Revised the Iso-lines application; now all contour levels are generated, and the \"intervals\" option works\r\n- Solved: fonts (labels, annotations, space time cube axes and coordinates) did not display correctly on some graphics cards, looking transparent\r\n- Viewing a classmap or a class attribute and turning classes on/off through the representation legend now works properly\r\n- Revised the polygon to raster and the raster to polygon applications\r\n- Solved: The Unique ID application was forgetting the first point\r\n- The grid on curved images (using a tiepoint georeference set to \"Full Second Order\") is now drawn \"curved\"\r\n- Graticule spacing is now expressed in Degrees, Minutes, Seconds (instead of Decimal Degrees)\r\n- MapCalc now also works with images that are more than 32768 pixels wide; the limit is increased to 2 billion pixels wide(!)\r\n- Added the Random Colors option to the possible color schemes for class maps\r\n- Added option \"Break Dependencies\" on a \"Dependent\" Georeference like SubMap, which will replace it with a standalone Georeference Corners when possible\r\n- Restored the ilwis.exe option –CR <command> to start ILWIS in hidden-mainwindow mode; to start it without a command, the option is \"–CR hide\"; this is different than the -C option which will execute the command and close ILWIS\r\n- Value images with very few values (e.g. 2 values) will now display with the correct colors\r\n- SegmentMapGlue is now able to correctly glue segment maps that have different coordinate systems\r\n- Importing tiff files with data type \"unsigned integer\" now works correctly (the range is 0-65535 instead of 0-32767)\r\n- Operations \"Iso Lines\", \"Voronoi\" and \"Point to Segment\" are now properly categorized in the Right-mouse-button menu\r\n- Wildcards are now allowed in command \"crmaplist\", for easier creation of maplists on the command-line\r\n- It is now possible to use an attribute of domain \"Color\" to color a layer\r\n- The Aggregate Maplist application is now also able to work with large maplists (previously it crashed after a certain threshold)\r\n- Re-added the operations MapKrigingSimple, MapKrigingOrdinary, MapKrigingAnisotropic and MapKrigingUniversal\r\n- The export of Color images into GeoTiff via the ILWIS export method is made faster\r\n- The default color for single colored maps can now be set in the ILWIS Preferences\r\n- Added more representations for value maps\r\n- Many other minor bugs and glitches are solved\r\n\r\n## Files\r\nYou can download the big one file download or the split version.\r\n\r\nPlease ignore the source code downloads here.
